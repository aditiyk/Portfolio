        <h2>Why I started coding...</h2>
        <p>
         
         My name is Aditi and with a bit of luck and a somewhat absurd wbjee rank, I managed to pursue a Btech degree in 
         Information Technology. Although I had been trained vocally for the past 12 years, I never dreamed of being a singer. 
         Rather I always wanted to pursue science... I wanted to be creative with technology.. to create someting new... but- 
         hang on, wait a second. NOT COMPUTER SCIENCE.

         On a day to day basis I find myself doing the funniest things- like fangirling over korean celebrities,
         dancing to the background music of the daily soaps my mother watches, staying awake till 4 am trying to make a website that even a three year old can make and also... start coding randomly. That's exactly how it all started.


         After my continuous failed attempts at learning c in my first  and second year at college, I finally decided to buy a book on java and a course on Udemy about web development by Brad Schiff. 

         After forcing myself to read the first few pages, I slowly started to get the hang of it. I guess java ended up forgiving me for not having coded ever before in my life unlike C. I thoroughly enjoyed the lectures by Brad and when exclaimed "excellent!" in his videos, I found myself chuckling and pumped up to learn even more.

         The right book and the right teacher can change your perspective about many things... And so, here I am- a certain someone in her 20's trying to code and finally finding a reason to code.  

         Anyway, so that became rather lengthy... I wasn't meaning to write so much but well, this seems rather perfect to me. If you've read this far, I'd like to thank you for that. I hope browsing this website is an enjoyable experience. I'll work harder and make even better websites in the future! Thank you.
