         &ldquo;Not all those who wander are lost.&rdquo; but not all those who are lost, wander. Sometimes they get stuck in one place, 
         unable to move until they find a reason to do so. My love for development started that way too. As someone who came from a non-CS
        background, I have succeeded to dive deep into HTML, CSS and JavaScript.<br>

         <br>Making websites is way for me to get my creative juices flowing. As I have further continued my Web development journey, 
         it has led me to discover really powerful tools like Node.JS and MongoDB. Since I prefer working on CRUD applications more, 
         Node.Js and MongoDB are the perfect combination for that. 
         <br>

         <br>This project, however, is only made to showcase my front-end knowledge. In the future I would love to make projects 
         that include chats and live updates in order to branch little furthur. 
         <br>

         <br>As a student, I have to acknowledge that my knowledge is still very limited and I have a lot more to learn. However, 
         I am passitionate to continue as web development and making great websites is necessary in this technology-driven era.   <br>

        <br> I've also expanded my learning to Data Science and Machine Learning. Besides diving deep into technology, I like to spend my time 
        watching Korean Dramas, reading a good novel or uploading music videos on my youtube channel.<br>

         <br>I wish to work for a company that would allow me to be creative and help me to grow and learn more. As I thrive in a more competitive
         environment, I would really love to work for such a company and leverage my web development knowledge to create something valuable and profitable.
         Thank you very much for reading. I hove you have a lovely time browsing this website.
